# Dataset Prioritization

### Why?

Searching for data is not easy. After this, choosing the right datasets for your machine learning use cases isn't easy either. The amount of time used to check the quality and costs of a dataset seems like a waste, but is definitely neccessary. This project wants to make it easier for you.

##### You know... that's called Data Profiling!

True. But todays data profiling software only checks for quality. This project also wants to check for other criterias.
