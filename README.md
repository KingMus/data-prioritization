# Dataset Prioritization

### What?

Prioritize datasets you want to use for your use case as easy as possible. 

### Why?

Searching for data is not easy. After this, choosing the right datasets for your machine learning use cases isn't easy either. The amount of time used to check the quality and costs of a dataset seems like a waste, but is definitely neccessary. This project wants to make it easier for you.

##### You know... that's called Data Profiling!

True. But todays data profiling software only checks for quality. This project also wants to calculate other criterias.

### How?

Python and Pandas are used to load the datasets and calculate some criterias. They are compared and result in a winner.

### Problems with the current solution

* The datasets must be owned by you. Thats bad, but I'm working on a solution.
* Some factors aren't devised nor implemented
* The actual code is dumb. This will change soon.
